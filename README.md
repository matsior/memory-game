# Memory Game - Motorola recruitment task

## Why do I code
My main purpose of coding is professional, i think it's important to separate work and free time. Mostly because when time to work comes, you can focus 100% on completing task and when free time comes your mind need some rest. Anyway coding is also my hobby,  I feel satisfaction after solving ocurring problems or after learning new technologies and tools.
